The http_client module - todo
======================

- connection parameters
	timeout=x		- DONE
	read=line/all		- Implemented in API, but not in parameter
	tlsverify=on/off
	failover=httpcon	Other httpcon that can be used for failover in case of 5xx response or timeout
	httpredirect		- DONE
	useragent		- DONE


- Make sure modparams work
	httpproxy		- Not working with curl
	tls cert, key, ca	- Not working with curl yet
	httpredirect		- done
	timeout			- done
	maxdatasize		- done
	
- Add XAVP parameter setting before running curl_connect

- save fingerprint of cert for trust-on-first-use procedure

- status for httpcon-object, needs to be object in process memory, so child_init
	- if 5xx response or timeout set flag
	- function in dialplan - httpcon_exists(object)
	- pv $curlstatus(object) ??
	- this is per process !!!

- Figure out a way to communicate back the content-type of the response. Another pvar arg?
	- This is per process!

- pv for curl error codes (result < 100)
	$curlerror(code)	Result string - DONE

- rpc
	curl.listcon	list all connection objects with properties
			-- Done, but not documented
	curl.modcon     modify connection object
			url
			username
			password
			scheme
			timeout
			read
			tlsverify
			failover
	curl.addcon	add connection object
	curl.rmcon	remove connection object


- Async - event_route when done
	(with and without suspending transaction)
	Need background task process to run curl request
	event_route[curl:connectioncomplete]
	$curlcon == connection
	$curl == URL
	$curlres == result

- API for other modules - done by Hugh Waite
	- Needs documentation
